        Hi! My name is Jonathan Zachary and I am a fullstack web developer. I
        came to this carreer after two decades of studying and teaching chess.
        After I graduated from the coding bootcamp General Assembly I was asked
        to stay on as a teacher. It was a perfect fit with my past teaching
        experience and it allowed me to refine my understanding of web
        development by creating lessons and exercises that illustrate the core
        competencies of modern web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studying and teaching chess for the past two decades has honed my
        ability solve abstract problems and communicate those solutions clearly.
        I have wide ranging interests from math to poetry. My ability to teach
        myself coupled with my curiosity has led me to a life-long love of
        learning. I enjoy building relationships based on exchanging knowledge,
        empathy, and communal problem solving
      </p>
